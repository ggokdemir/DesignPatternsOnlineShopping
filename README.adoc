* Site has two versions. One in web browser and one in the app store.
* There platforms have same responsibilityl. So i used factory pattert to easily configure it.

* Our clients could have problems about their purchase. So we have a call center system.
* But as like all companies. We have limitted employee for clients.
* Object pool pattern solved this problem.


*5. Builder Pattern*

image::5.Builder/image.png[image]


* There is a two kind a membership program on our platform. 
* MinimalMembership and FullFeatured membership. 
* With Minimal membership customer can have 10 percent discount on every second product.
* In other case, with FullFeatured membership customer can get %10 discount on second, %20 discount on third
%50 discount on fourth product.


*1. Abstract Factory Pattern*

image::6.AbstractFactory/image.png[image]


* We have technology store on our shopping site, there are high performance computers.
* Customer can choose their computer as desktop or notebook.
* Also we have two type of computers one is Gaming other is Workstation.
* Without abstract factory pattern there could be multiple classes. And if we wanted to change some configuration.
It could be hard for us to add and remove.
