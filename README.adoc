IMPORTANT: A header is optional.

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.


`sectanchors`::
When this document attribute is set, a section icon anchor appears in front of the section title.


NOTE: Section title anchors depend on the default Asciidoctor stylesheet to render properly.

== Images

Images are resolved relative to the value of the {uri-imagesdir}[imagesdir] document attribute, which is empty by default.
You are encouraged to make use of the `imagesdir` attribute to avoid hard-coding the common path to your images in every image macro.

* The order of `id` and `role` values in the shorthand syntax does not matter.
